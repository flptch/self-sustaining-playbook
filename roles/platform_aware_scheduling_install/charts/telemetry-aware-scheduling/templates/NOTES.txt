The {{ .Chart.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Version }} was installed.

You can now create a scheduling policy.

Scheduling policy example:

apiVersion: telemetry.intel.com/v1alpha1
kind: TASPolicy
metadata:
  name: scheduling-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  strategies:
    deschedule:
      rules:
      - metricname: node_metric
        operator: Equals
        target: -1
    dontschedule:
      rules:
      - metricname: node_metric
        operator: LessThan
        target: 10
    scheduleonmetric:
      rules:
      - metricname: node_metric
        operator: GreaterThan

To link a workload to a scheduling policy add a label of the form telemetry-policy=<POLICY-NAME>.
